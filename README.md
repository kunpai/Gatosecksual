Discord bot to send random photos of our "pet" cat.

It was a warm day in spring when we were introduced to this beautiful, majestic cat, roaming around our backyard.

Her glistening fur, bathed in the golden sunlight, shimmered hope onto us during our trying times.

And then, she brought with her her family of 16 cats: some old, some young, some like her, some completely different.

Adding them to our family, we watched them grow just as much as they saw us grow.

And to honor her, I made this bot to spread her photos across the servers that would have her.
